Feline is a Lua statusline that prioritizes speed, customizability and
minimalism. It’s blazing fast and never gets in your way. Feline only
provides you with the necessary tools that you need to customize the statusline
to your liking and avoids feature-bloat. It’s also extremely customizable and
allows you to configure it in any way you wish to. Feline also has reasonable
defaults for those who don’t want to configure things and just want a good
out of the box experience.

USAGE                                                           *feline-usage*

Once you’ve installed Feline, it’s very easy to start using it. Here are
the following options for using Feline:

1. USING DEFAULT STATUSLINE ~

If you want an opinionated statusline that "just works", then you can just use
Feline’s default statusline, for which you just have to add the `setup()`
function to your config:

>
    require('feline').setup()
<


In case you don’t like icons and want to use the default statusline
configuration without icons, just do:

>
    require('feline').setup({
        preset = 'noicon'
    })
<


NOTE: This is also the configuration used by default if you don’t have
`nvim-web-devicons`. You don’t have to specify it manually in case you
don’t have `nvim-web-devicons`. In that case, Feline will detect that you
don’t have `nvim-web-devicons` and automatically pick the `noicon` preset.

You can also make minor tweaks like changing the default foreground and
background color like this:

>
    require('feline').setup {
        colors = {
            fg = '#D0D0D0',
            bg = '#1F1F23'
        }
    }
<


2. BUILDING YOUR OWN STATUSLINE ~

If you don’t mind getting your hands dirty, then I recommend making your own
statusline, it’s very easy to do so, but for that you have to first
understand how Feline works.<br><br>Feline has a statusline generator that
takes a `components` value, which is a Lua table that needs to contain the
statusline components.

                                                           *feline-Components*

Components                             Inside the `components` table, there
                                       needs to be two tables, `active` and
                                       `inactive`, which will dictate whether
                                       the component is a part of the
                                       statusline when it’s in an active
                                       window or an inactive window. And inside
                                       each of the `active` and `inactive`
                                       tables, you can put any amount of
                                       tables, each of which will indicate a
                                       section of the statusline. For example,
                                       if you want two sections (left and
                                       right), you can put two tables inside
                                       each of the `active` and `inactive`
                                       tables. If you want three sections
                                       (left, mid and right), you can put three
                                       tables inside each of the `active` and
                                       `inactive` tables. There is no limit to
                                       the amount of sections you can have.
                                       It’s also possible to have a different
                                       amount of sections for the `active` and
                                       `inactive` statuslines.


So first, in your init.lua file, you have to initialize the components table

>
    -- Initialize the components table
    local components = {
        active = {},
        inactive = {}
    }
<


You can then add new sections to the statusline by adding an element to the
`active` or `inactive` tables. For example:

>
    -- Insert three sections (left, mid and right) for the active statusline
    table.insert(components.active, {})
    table.insert(components.active, {})
    table.insert(components.active, {})
    
    -- Insert two sections (left and right) for the inactive statusline
    table.insert(components.inactive, {})
    table.insert(components.inactive, {})
<


Now you can add statusline components to each of those sections by adding
elements to the sections. For example:

>
    -- Insert a component that will be on the left side of the statusline
    -- when the window is active:
    table.insert(components.active[1], {
        -- Component info here
    })
    
    -- Insert another component that will be on the left side of the statusline
    -- when the window is active:
    table.insert(components.active[1], {
        -- Component info here
    })
    
    -- Insert a component that will be on the middle of the statusline
    -- when the window is active:
    table.insert(components.active[2], {
        -- Component info here
    })
    
    -- Insert a component that will be on the right side of the statusline
    -- when the window is active:
    table.insert(components.active[3], {
        -- Component info here
    })
    
    -- Insert a component that will be on the left side of the statusline
    -- when the window is inactive:
    table.insert(components.inactive[1], {
        -- Component info here
    })
    
    -- Insert a component that will be on the right side of the statusline
    -- when the window is inactive:
    table.insert(components.inactive[2], {
        -- Component info here
    })
<


Alternatively you can also use Lua table indices instead of table.insert, like:

>
    -- Insert a component that will be on the right side of the statusline
    -- when the window is active:
    components.active[3][1] = {
        -- Component info here
    }
    
    -- Insert another component that will be on the right side of the statusline
    -- when the window is active:
    components.active[3][2] = {
        -- Component info here
    }
<


**NOTE:** If you use the index instead of table.insert, remember to put the
correct index. Also keep in mind that unlike most other programming languages,
Lua indices start at `1` instead of `0`.

You can customize each component to your liking. Most values that a component
requires can also use a function. However, these functions cannot take any
arguments, with the exception of the `provider` and `enabled` values, which can
take arguments (more about that below).

Feline will automatically evaluate the function if it is one. But in case a
function is provided, the type of the value the function returns must be the
same as the type of value required by the component. For example, since
`enabled` requires a boolean value, if you set it to a function, the function
must also return a boolean value.

Note that you can omit all of the component values except `provider`, in which
case the defaults would be used instead. A component can have the following
values:


- `provider` (string or function): If it’s a string, it represents the text to show. If it’s a function, it must return a string when called. As a function it may also optionally return an `icon` component alongside the string when called, which would represent the provider’s icon, possibly along with the icon highlight group configuration. The function can take either no arguments, or one argument which would contain the component itself, or it can take two arguments, the component and the window handler of the window for which the statusline is being generated.


>
    -- Provider that shows current line in file
    provider = function()
        return string.format('%d:%d', vim.fn.line('.'), vim.fn.col('.'))
    end
    
    -- Providers can also take the component as an argument
    provider = function(component)
        if component.icon then
            return component.icon
        else
            return ''
        end
    end
    
    -- Providers can also take the window handler as an argument
    provider = function(component, winid)
        return (component.icon or '') .. tostring(vim.api.nvim_win_get_buf(winid))
    end
    
    -- If you only need the window handler, you can avoid using the component value like this:
    provider = function(_, winid)
        return vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(winid)[1]
    end
    
    -- Providers can also simply just contain a string, such as:
    provider = 'some text here'
<


There are also some |feline-default-providers|, to use them, you just use the
provider name like this:

>
    provider = 'position' -- This will use the default file position provider.
<


Note that you can also use your |feline-manually-added-providers| the same way


- `enabled` (boolean or function): Determines if the component is enabled. If false, the component is not shown in the statusline. If it’s a function that returns a boolean value, it can take either the window handler as an argument, or it can take no arguments. For example:


>
    -- Enable if opened file has a valid size
    enabled = function()
        return vim.fn.getfsize(vim.fn.expand('%:p')) > 0
    end
    
    -- Enable if current window width is higher than 80
    enabled = function(winid)
        return vim.api.nvim_win_get_width(winid) > 80
    end
<



- `icon` (table or string): Some inbuilt providers such as `git_branch` provide default icons. If you either don’t have a patched font or don’t like the default icon that Feline provides, or if you want an icon for a component that doesn’t have any default icons, you may set this value to use any icon you want instead. By default, the icon inherits the component’s highlight, but you can also change the highlight specifically for the icon. To do this, you need to pass a table containing `str` and `hl`, where `str` would represent the icon and `hl` would represent the icon highlight. The icon’s highlight works just like the `hl` component’s values. For example:


>
    -- Setting icon to a string
    icon = ' + '
    
    -- Setting icon to a function
    icon = function() return ' - ' end
    
    -- Setting icon to a table
    icon = {
        str = ' ~ ',
        hl = { fg = 'orange' },
    }
<



- `hl` (table or string): Determines the highlight settings.<br>
    If a string, it’ll use the given string as the name of the component highlight group. In that case, this highlight group must be defined elsewhere (i.e. in your colorscheme or your nvim config).<br>
    If it’s a table, it’ll automatically generate a highlight group for you based on the given values. The hl table can have three values:
    - `hl.fg` (string): RGB hex or |feline-name| of foreground color. (eg: `'#FFFFFF'`, `'white'`).<br>By default it uses the default foreground color provided in the `setup()` function.
    - `hl.bg` (string): RGB hex or |feline-name| of background color. (eg: `#000000'`, `'black'`).<br>By default it uses the default background color provided in the `setup()` function.
    - `hl.style` (string): Formatting style of text. (eg: `'bold,undercurl'`).<br>By default it is set to `'NONE'`
    - `hl.name` (string): Name of highlight group created by Feline (eg: `'StatusComponentVimInsert'`).<br><br>Note that if `hl` is a function that can return different values, the highlight is not redefined if the name stays the same. Feline only creates highlights when they don’t exist, it never redefines existing highlights. So if `hl` is a function that can return different values for `hl.fg`, `hl.bg` or `hl.style`, make sure to return a different value for `hl.name` as well if you want the highlight to actually change. If a name is not provided, Feline automatically generates a unique name for the highlight group based on the other values. So you can also just omit the `name` and Feline will create new highlights for you when required.<br><br>Setting `hl.name` may provide a performance improvement since Feline caches highlight names and doesn’t take the time to generate a name if the name is already provided by the user.


An example of using the hl group:

>
    -- As a table
    hl = {
        fg = 'skyblue'
    }
    
    -- As a string
    hl = "MyStatuslineHLGroup"
    
    -- As a function returning a table
    hl = function()
        return {
            name = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_highlight_name(),
            fg = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color(),
            style = 'bold'
        }
    end
    
    -- As a function returning a string
    hl = function()
      if require("feline.providers.vi_mode").get_vim_mode() == "NORMAL" then
        return "MyStatuslineNormal"
      else
        return "MyStatuslineOther"
      end
    end
<


<br>

**NOTE:** Some providers may also have special component values unique to them,
such as the `file_info` provider having a `file_modified_icon` value that you
can set. For more info, see: |feline-default-providers|. <br><br>

SEPARATORS

There are two types of separator values that you can put in a component, which
are `left_sep` and `right_sep`, which represent the separator on the left and
the right side of the component, respectively.

The value of `left_sep` and `right_sep` can just be set to a string that’s
displayed. You can use a function that returns a string just like the other
component values. The value can also be equal to the name of one of the
|feline-separator-presets|.

The value of `left_sep` and `right_sep` can also be a table or a function
returning a table. Inside the table there can be three values, `str`, `hl` and
`always_visible`. `str` represents the separator string and `hl` represents the
separator highlight. The separator’s highlight works just like the
component’s `hl` value. The only difference is that the separator’s `hl` by
default uses the parent’s background color as its foreground color.

By default, Feline doesn’t show the separator if the value returned by the
provider is empty. If you want the separator to be shown even when the
component string is empty, you can set the `always_visible` value in the
separator table to `true`. If unset or set to `false`, the separator is not
shown if the component string is empty.

You can also set `left_sep` and `right_sep` to be a `table` containing multiple
separator elements. It’s useful if you want to have different highlights for
different parts of the left/right separator of the same component, or if you
want to always show certain parts of the separator regardless of whether the
component string is empty, or if you just want to better organize the
component’s separator.

For example:

>
    -- Setting sep to a string
    left_sep = ' '
    
    -- Setting sep to a separator preset
    left_sep = 'slant_right'
    
    -- Setting sep to a table with highlight
    left_sep = {
        str = 'slant_left',
        hl = {
            fg = 'oceanblue',
            bg = 'bg'
        }
    }
    
    -- Making sep always visible
    right_sep = {
        str = ' ',
        always_visible = true
    }
    
    -- Setting sep to a function
    right_sep = function()
        local values = { 'right_rounded', 'right_filled', 'right' }
        return values[math.random(#values)]
    end
    
    -- Setting sep to a list separator elements
    right_sep = {
        {
            str = ' ',
            hl = {
                fg = 'NONE',
                bg = 'oceanblue'
            },
            always_visible = true
        },
        -- The line below is equivalent to { str = 'slant_right' }
        'slant_right'
    }
<


COMPONENT EXAMPLE

Now that we know of the possible values you can set in a component, let’s
make some actual components to show you how it all looks like together:

Component example

>
    -- Component that shows Vi mode with highlight
    components.active[1][1] = {
        provider = 'vi_mode',
        hl = function()
            return {
                name = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_highlight_name(),
                fg = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color(),
                style = 'bold'
            }
        end,
        right_sep = ' '
    }
    
    -- Component that shows file info
    components.active[1][2] = {
        provider = 'file_info',
        hl = {
            fg = 'white',
            bg = 'oceanblue',
            style = 'bold'
        },
        left_sep = {' ', 'slant_left_2'},
        right_sep = {'slant_right_2', ' '},
        -- Uncomment the next line to disable file icons
        -- icon = ''
    }
    
    -- Component that shows current file size
    components.active[1][3] = {
        provider = 'file_size',
        right_sep = {
            ' ',
            {
                str = 'slant_left_2_thin',
                hl = {
                    fg = 'fg',
                    bg = 'bg'
                }
            },
            ' '
        }
    }
    
    -- Component that shows file encoding
    components.active[2][1] = {
        provider = 'file_encoding'
    }
    
    -- Component that shows current git branch
    components.active[3][1] = {
        provider = 'git_branch',
        hl = {
            fg = 'white',
            bg = 'black',
            style = 'bold'
        },
        right_sep = {
            str = ' ',
            hl = {
                fg = 'NONE',
                bg = 'black'
            }
        }
    }
<


[**NOTE:** Remember to initialize the components table before assigning
anything to it]

VALUE PRESETS

Value presets are names for colors and separators that you can use instead of
the hex code or separator string, respectively.

For your ease of use, Feline has some default color and separator values set.
You can manually access them through `require('feline.defaults').colors` and
`require('feline.defaults').separators` respectively. But there’s a much
easier way to use them, which is to just directly assign the name of the color
or separator to the value, eg:

>
    hl = {bg = 'oceanblue'},
    right_sep = 'slant_right'
<


Not only that, you can add your own custom colors and separators through
|feline-the-setup-function| which allows you to just use the name of the color
or separator to refer to it.

Below is a list of all the default value names and their values:

DEFAULT COLORS

│    Name     │    Value    │
│fg           │'#D0D0D0'    │
│bg           │'#1F1F23'    │
│black        │'#1B1B1B'    │
│skyblue      │'#50B0F0'    │
│cyan         │'#009090'    │
│green        │'#60A040'    │

                                                       *feline-Setup-function*

Setup function                         Now that we’ve learned to set up both
                                       the components table, it’s finally
                                       time to revisit the setup function. The
                                       setup function takes a table that can
                                       have the following values:



- `preset` - Set it to use a preconfigured statusline. Currently it can be equal to either `default` for the default statusline or `noicon` for the default statusline without icons. You don’t have to put any of the other values if you use a preset, but if you do, your settings will override the preset’s settings. To see more info such as how to modify a preset to build a statusline, see: |feline-modifying-an-existing-preset|
- `components` - The components table.
- `colors` - A table containing custom |feline-color-value-presets|. The value of `colors.fg` and `colors.bg` also represent the default foreground and background colors, respectively.
- `separators` - A table containing custom |feline-separator-value-presets|.
- `update_triggers` - A list of autocmds that trigger an update of the statusline in inactive windows.<br>
    Default: `{'VimEnter', 'WinEnter', 'WinClosed', 'FileChangedShellPost'}`
- `force_inactive` - A table that determines which buffers should always have the inactive statusline, even when they are active. It can have 3 values inside of it, `filetypes`, `buftypes` and `bufnames`, all three of them are tables which contain file types, buffer types and buffer names respectively.<br><br>
    Default:


>
    {
        filetypes = {
            'NvimTree',
            'packer',
            'startify',
            'fugitive',
            'fugitiveblame',
            'qf',
            'help'
        },
        buftypes = {
            'terminal'
        },
        bufnames = {}
    }
<



- `disable` - Similar to `force_inactive`, except the statusline is disabled completely. Configured the same way as `force_inactive`. Feline doesn’t disable the statusline on anything by default.
- `vi_mode_colors` - A table containing colors associated with Vi modes. It can later be used to get the color associated with the current Vim mode using `require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color()`. For more info on it see the |feline-vi-mode| section.<br><br>
    Here is a list of all possible vi_mode names used with the default color associated with them:


│    Mode     │     Description     │    Value    │
│NORMAL       │Normal mode          │'green'      │
│OP           │Operator pending mode│'green'      │
│INSERT       │Insert mode          │'red'        │
│VISUAL       │Visual mode          │'skyblue'    │
│LINES        │Visual lines mode    │'skyblue'    │
│BLOCK        │Visual block mode    │'skyblue'    │
│REPLACE      │Replace mode         │'violet'     │
│V-REPLACE    │Virtual Replace mode │'violet'     │
│ENTER        │Enter mode           │'cyan'       │
│MORE         │More mode            │'cyan'       │
│SELECT       │Select mode          │'orange'     │
│COMMAND      │Command mode         │'green'      │
│SHELL        │Shell mode           │'green'      │
│TERM         │Terminal mode        │'green'      │
│NONE         │None                 │'yellow'     │


                                                *feline-Example-configuration*

Example configuration                  Now that you know how to create Feline
                                       components, you can check out the code
                                       in the default preset
                                       <lua/feline/presets/default.lua> to see
                                       how the components in it are set up so
                                       you can get a good practical idea of how
                                       to use the tools that Feline gives you.


3. MODIFYING AN EXISTING PRESET ~

If you like the defaults for the most part but there’s some things you want
to change, then you’d be glad to know that it’s easy to just modify an
existing preset to get the statusline configuration you want. Just do:

>
    -- Substitute preset_name with the name of the preset you want to modify.
    -- eg: "default" or "noicon"
    local components = require('feline.presets')[preset_name].components
<


After that, you can just modify the components and call
|feline-the-setup-function| with the preset as you normally would.

PROVIDERS                                                   *feline-providers*

DEFAULT PROVIDERS ~

Feline by default has some built-in providers to make your life easy. They are:

│             Name             │                Description                │
│|feline-vi_mode|              │Current vim mode                           │
│position                      │Get line and column number of cursor       │
│line_percentage               │Current line percentage                    │
│scroll_bar                    │Scroll bar that shows file progress        │
│|feline-file_info|            │Get file icon, name and modified status    │
│file_size                     │Get file size                              │
│file_type                     │Get file type                              │
│file_encoding                 │Get file encoding                          │
│|feline-git_branch|           │Shows current git branch                   │
│|feline-git_diff_added|       │Git diff added count                       │
│|feline-git_diff_removed|     │Git diff removed count                     │
│|feline-git_diff_changed|     │Git diff changed count                     │
│lsp_client_names              │Name of LSP clients attached to current buf│
│                              │fer                                        │
│|feline-diagnostic_errors|    │Diagnostics errors count                   │
│                              │                                           │
│|feline-diagnostic_warnings|  │Diagnostics warnings count                 │
│                              │                                           │
│|feline-diagnostic_hints|     │Diagnostics hints count                    │
│|feline-diagnostic_info|      │Diagnostics info count                     │


                                                              *feline-Vi-mode*

Vi-mode                                The vi-mode provider by itself only
                                       shows an icon. To actually indicate the
                                       current Vim mode, you have to use
                                       `require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color()`
                                       for the component’s `hl.fg`.


Note that this is different if you set the `icon` value of the component to
`''`, in that case it’ll use the name of the mode instead of an icon, which
is what the `noicon` preset uses.

Here is the simplest method to make a component with proper Vi-mode indication:

>
    -- Remember to change "components.active[1][1]" according to the rest of your config
    components.active[1][1] = {
        provider = 'vi_mode',
        hl = function()
            return {
                name = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_highlight_name(),
                fg = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color(),
                style = 'bold'
            }
        end,
        right_sep = ' ',
        -- Uncomment the next line to disable icons for this component and use the mode name instead
        -- icon = ''
    }
<


The Vi-mode provider also provides a helper function
`get_mode_highlight_name()` which can be used through
`require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_highlight_name()`, it returns the
highlight name for the current mode, which you can then use for the
provider’s `hl.name` to give its highlight groups meaningful names.

                                                            *feline-File-Info*

File Info                              The `file_info` provider has some
                                       special component values:



- `colored_icon` (boolean): Determines whether file icon should use color
    inherited from `nvim-web-devicons`.<br> Default: `true`
- `file_modified_icon` (string): The icon that is shown when a file is
    modified.<br> Default:`'●'`
- `file_readonly_icon` (string): The icon that is shown when a file is
    read-only.<br> Default:`'🔒'`
- `type` (string): Determines which parts of the filename are shown. Its value
    can be one of:
    - `'full-path'`: Full path of the file (eg: `'/home/user/.config/nvim/init.lua'`)
    - `'short-path'`: Shortened path of the file (eg: `'/h/u/.c/n/init.lua'`)
    - `'base-only'`: Show only base filename and extension (eg: `'init.lua'`)
    - `'relative'`: File path relative to the current directory.
    - `'relative-short'`: Combination of `'relative'` and `'short-path'`.
    - `'unique'`: Unique substring of the full path.<br>
        For example: If you have three buffers with the paths `'/home/user/file.lua'`, `'/home/user/dir1/file.lua'` and `'/home/user/dir2/file.lua'`, Feline will show the names `'user/file.lua'`, `'dir1/file.lua'` and `'dir2/file.lua'` for them, respectively.<br>
        If there’s no files that share the same name, it behaves the same as `'base-only'`.
    - `'unique-short'`: Combination of `'unique'` and `'short-path'`.
    <br>Default: `'base-only'`


                                                                  *feline-Git*

Git                                    The git providers all require
                                       gitsigns.nvim
                                       <https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim/>,
                                       make sure you have it installed when you
                                       use those providers, otherwise they’ll
                                       have no output.


The git provider also provides a utility function
`require('feline.providers.git').git_info_exists(winid)` (where `winid` is the
window handler) for checking if any git information exists in the window
through this utility function.

                                                          *feline-Diagnostics*

Diagnostics                            The diagnostics and LSP providers all
                                       require the Neovim built-in LSP to be
                                       configured and at least one LSP client
                                       to be attached to the current buffer,
                                       else they’ll have no output.


The diagnostics provider also provides a utility function
`require('feline.providers.lsp').diagnostics_exist(type, winid)` (where `type`
represents the type of diagnostic and `winid` is the window handler) for
checking if any diagnostics of the provided type exists in the window. The
values of `type` must be one of `'Error'`, `'Warning'`, `'Hint'` or
`'Information'`.

ADDING YOUR OWN PROVIDER ~

In case none of the default providers do what you want, it’s very easy to add
your own provider. Just call `require('feline.providers').add_provider(name,
function)` where `name` is the name of the provider and `function` is the
function associated with the provider, you can then use your provider the same
way you use the other providers. Remember, the function has to take either no
argument, or one argument that contains the component and its values.

HELP                                                             *feline-help*

COMMON ISSUES ~


  Feline crashes or disappears for seemingly no reason


This can be caused if you forget to remove your other statusline plugins after
installing Feline. Make sure all other statusline plugins are removed before
you install Feline, that should fix the issue.

TIPS AND TRICKS ~

                                                      *feline-Reset-highlight*

Reset highlight                        If, for some reason, you want to clear
                                       all highlights that Feline sets (useful
                                       if you want to reload your entire Neovim
                                       config which may mess up highlights),
                                       you can do:


>
    require('feline').reset_highlights()
<


And then Feline will automatically regenerate those highlights when it needs
them, so you don’t have to worry about setting the highlights yourself.

                                      *feline-Thin-line-for-horizontal-splits*

Thin line for horizontal splits        If you want, you can have a thin line
                                       instead of the inactive statusline to
                                       separate your windows, like the vertical
                                       window split separator, except in this
                                       case it would act as a horizontal window
                                       separator of sorts. You can do this
                                       through:


>
    local nvim_exec = vim.api.nvim_exec
    
    -- Get highlight of inactive statusline by parsing the style, fg and bg of VertSplit
    local InactiveStatusHL = {
        fg = nvim_exec("highlight VertSplit", true):match("guifg=(#[0-9A-Fa-f]+)") or "#444444",
        bg = nvim_exec("highlight VertSplit", true):match("guibg=(#[0-9A-Fa-f]+)") or "#1E1E1E",
        style = nvim_exec("highlight VertSplit", true):match("gui=(#[0-9A-Fa-f]+)") or "",
    }
    
    -- Add underline to inactive statusline highlight style
    -- in order to have a thin line instead of the statusline
    if InactiveStatusHL.style == '' then
        InactiveStatusHL.style = 'underline'
    else
        InactiveStatusHL.style = InactiveStatusHL.style .. ',underline'
    end
    
    -- Apply the highlight to the statusline
    -- by having an empty provider with the highlight
    components.inactive = {
        {
            {
                provider = '',
                hl = InactiveStatusHL
            }
        }
    }
