1. Usage                                                        *feline-usage*

This is a full guide to customizing Feline to build your own statusline
configuration from scratch. While this may look daunting at first, be assured
that this is very easy once you understand it. But before you can customize
Feline, you have to understand how Feline works.

COMPONENTS                                                 *feline-components*

Feline has a statusline generator that takes a `components` value, which is a
Lua table that needs to contain the statusline components. Inside the
`components` table, there needs to be two tables, `active` and `inactive`,
which will dictate whether the component is a part of the statusline when
it’s in an active window or an inactive window. Inside each of the `active`
and `inactive` tables, you can put any amount of tables, each of which will
indicate a section of the statusline.

For example, if you want two sections (left and right), you can put two tables
inside each of the `active` and `inactive` tables. If you want three sections
(left, mid and right), you can put three tables inside each of the `active` and
`inactive` tables. There is no limit to the amount of sections you can have.
It’s also possible to have a different amount of sections for the `active`
and `inactive` statuslines.

So first, in your init.lua file, you have to initialize the components table
like this:

>
    -- Initialize the components table
    local components = {
        active = {},
        inactive = {}
    }
<


You can then add new sections to the statusline by adding an element to the
`active` or `inactive` tables. For example:

>
    -- Insert three sections (left, mid and right) for the active statusline
    table.insert(components.active, {})
    table.insert(components.active, {})
    table.insert(components.active, {})
    
    -- Insert two sections (left and right) for the inactive statusline
    table.insert(components.inactive, {})
    table.insert(components.inactive, {})
<


Now you can add statusline components to each of those sections by adding
elements to the sections. For example:

>
    -- Insert a component that will be on the left side of the statusline
    -- when the window is active:
    table.insert(components.active[1], {
        -- Component info here
    })
    
    -- Insert another component that will be on the left side of the statusline
    -- when the window is active:
    table.insert(components.active[1], {
        -- Component info here
    })
    
    -- Insert a component that will be on the middle of the statusline
    -- when the window is active:
    table.insert(components.active[2], {
        -- Component info here
    })
    
    -- Insert a component that will be on the right side of the statusline
    -- when the window is active:
    table.insert(components.active[3], {
        -- Component info here
    })
    
    -- Insert a component that will be on the left side of the statusline
    -- when the window is inactive:
    table.insert(components.inactive[1], {
        -- Component info here
    })
    
    -- Insert a component that will be on the right side of the statusline
    -- when the window is inactive:
    table.insert(components.inactive[2], {
        -- Component info here
    })
<


Alternatively you can also use Lua table indices instead of table.insert, like:

>
    -- Insert a component that will be on the right side of the statusline
    -- when the window is active:
    components.active[3][1] = {
        -- Component info here
    }
    
    -- Insert another component that will be on the right side of the statusline
    -- when the window is active:
    components.active[3][2] = {
        -- Component info here
    }
<


**NOTE:** If you use the index instead of table.insert, remember to put the
correct index. Also keep in mind that unlike most other programming languages,
Lua indices start at `1` instead of `0`.

COMPONENT VALUES ~

You can use component values to customize each component to your liking.
Providing the values isn’t necessary and you can omit all of the component
values, in which case the defaults would be used instead. The component values
can either be set to a fixed value or a function that generates the value
everytime the statusline is being generated.

Though you should keep in mind that if a component value is set to a function,
the function can take no arguments. The |feline-`provider`| value is an
exception to this rule (more on that below). The return type of the function
must also be the same as the type of value required by the component. For
example, since |feline-`enabled`| requires a boolean value, if you set it to a
function, the function must also return a boolean value.

The different kinds of component values are discussed below.

                                                  *feline-Component-providers*

Component providers                    The `provider` value of a component can
                                       be a table, string or function.


If it’s a string, it represents the text to show.

>
    -- Providers can simply just contain a string, such as:
    provider = 'some text here'
<


A string value can also refer to a |feline-default-provider|. When the name of
a default provider is used as the value of `provider`, it uses the default
provider for the component.

>
    provider = 'position' -- This will use the default file position provider
<


Some of these providers can also take some special options, in which case the
value of `provider` can be a table containing two values: `name` which
represents the name of the provider, and `opts` which represents the options
passed to the provider.

>
    provider = {
        name = 'file_info',
        opts = {
            type = 'unique',
            file_modified_icon = 'M'
        }
    }
<


Note that you can also use your |feline-manually-added-providers| the same way
as the default providers.

The value of `provider` can also be set to a function. The function must return
a string when called. The function may also optionally return an
|feline-`icon`| value alongside the string, which would represent the
provider’s default icon. The provider functions can take two arguments:
`component`, which represents the component itself and can be used to access
the component values from within the provider, and `opts`, which represents the
provider options discussed above.

Here are a few examples of setting the provider to a function:

>
    -- Here's an example of a basic provider with no arguments
    provider = function()
        return tostring(#vim.api.nvim_list_wins())
    end
    
    -- Providers can take the component itself as an argument to access the component values using the
    -- first argument passed to the provider function
    provider = function(component)
        if component.icon then
            return component.icon
        else
            return ''
        end
    end
<


Functions that are added as |feline-custom-providers| can also take a second
argument, `opts`, which represents the provider options given to the provider
(if any). For example:

>
    provider = function(_, opts)
        if opts.return_two then
            return 2
        else
            return 3
        end
    end
<


If you omit the provider value, it will be set to an empty string. A component
with no provider or an empty provider may be useful for things like
|feline-applying-a-highlight-to-section-gaps| or just having an icon or
separator as a component.

UPDATE PROVIDER VALUE USING TRIGGERS

Sometimes the provider value has to do some heavy operations, which makes it
undesirable to run the provider function every time the statusline is
generated. Feline allows you to conditionally re-run the provider function by
triggering an update to the provider string through either an autocmd or a
function. Until the provider function is run again, the value from the previous
execution of the provider function is used as the provider string.

Updating provider value through triggers is achieved through the `update` key
in the `provider` table. `update` can be either a boolean value, a table or a
function that returns a boolean value or a table. If it’s a boolean value,
then the provider will be updated if value is `true`. For example:

>
    provider = {
        name = 'my_provider',
        -- Only update provider if there are less than 4 windows in the current tabpage
        update = function()
            return #vim.api.nvim_tabpage_list_wins(0) < 4
        end
    }
<


If it’s a table, it must contain a list of autocmds that will trigger an
update for the provider. For example:

>
    provider = {
        name = 'my_provider',
        -- Only update provider if a window is closed or if a buffer is deleted
        update = { 'WinClosed', 'BufDelete' }
    }
<


                                                       *feline-Component-name*

Component name                         A component can optionally be given a
                                       name. While the component is not
                                       required to have a name and the name is
                                       mostly useless, it can be used to check
                                       if the component has been
                                       |feline-truncated|. To give a component
                                       a name, just set its `name` value to a
                                       `string`, shown below:


>
    local my_component = {
        name = 'a_unique_name'
    }
<


Two components inside the `active` or `inactive` table cannot share the same
name, so make sure to give all components unique names.

                                                           *feline-Truncation*

Truncation                             Feline has an automatic smart truncation
                                       system where components can be
                                       automatically truncated if the
                                       statusline doesn’t fit within the
                                       available space. It can be useful if you
                                       want to make better use of screen space.
                                       It also allows you to better manage
                                       which providers are truncated, how they
                                       are truncated and in which order they
                                       are truncated.


**NOTE:** Truncation only works on Neovim 0.6 and above. If you’re using an
earlier release, truncation will not work and all configurations related to it
will be silently ignored.

There are a few component values associated with truncation which are described
below.

COMPONENT SHORT PROVIDER

`short_provider` is an optional component value that allows you to take
advantage of Feline’s truncation system. Note that this should only be
defined if you want to enable truncation for the component, otherwise it’s
absolutely fine to omit it.

`short_provider` works just like the `provider` value, but is activated only
when the component is being truncated due to the statusline not fitting within
the window. `short_provider` is independent from the `provider` value so it can
be a different provider altogether, or it can be a shortened version of the
same provider or the same provider but with a different `opts` value. For
example:

>
    -- In this component, short provider uses same provider but with different opts
    local file_info_component = {
        provider = {
            name = 'file_info',
            opts = {
                type = 'full-path'
            }
        },
        short_provider = {
            name = 'file_info',
            opts = {
                type = 'short-path'
            }
        }
    }
    
    -- Short provider can also be an independent value / function
    local my_component = {
        provider = 'loooooooooooooooong',
        short_provider = 'short'
    }
<


Feline doesn’t set `short_provider` to any component by default, so it must
be provided manually.

HIDE COMPONENTS DURING TRUNCATION

If you wish to allow Feline to hide a component entirely if necessary during
truncation, you may set the `truncate_hide` component value to `true`. By
default, `truncate_hide` is `false` for every component.

COMPONENT PRIORITY

When components are being truncated by Feline, you can choose to give some
components a higher priority over the other components. The `priority`
component value just takes a number. By default, the priority of a component is
`0`. Components are truncated in ascending order of priority. So components
with lower priority are truncated first, while components with higher priority
are truncated later on. For example:

>
    -- This component has the default priority
    local my_component = {
        provider = 'loooooooooooooooong',
        short_provider = 'short'
    }
    -- This component has a higher priority, so it will be truncated after the previous component
    local high_priority_component = {
        provider = 'long provider with high priority',
        short_provider = 'short',
        priority = 1
    }
<


Priority can also be set to a negative number, which can be used to make a
component be truncated earlier than the ones with default priority.

CHECK IF COMPONENT IS TRUNCATED OR HIDDEN

If you give a component a `name`, you can check if that component has been
truncated or hidden by Feline’s smart truncation system through the utility
functions, `require('feline').is_component_truncated` and
`require('feline').is_component_hidden`. Both of these functions take two
arguments, `winid` which is the window id of the window for which the
component’s truncation is being checked, the second is the `name` of the
component. `is_component_truncated` returns `true` if a component has been
truncated or hidden, and `is_component_hidden` returns `true` only if a
component has been hidden.

                                      *feline-Conditionally-enable-components*

Conditionally enable components        The `enabled` value of a component can
                                       be a boolean or function. This value
                                       determines if the component is enabled
                                       or not. If false, the component is not
                                       shown in the statusline. For example:


>
    -- Enable if opened file has a valid size
    enabled = function()
        return vim.fn.getfsize(vim.fn.expand('%:p')) > 0
    end
    
    -- Enable if current window width is higher than 80
    enabled = function()
        return vim.api.nvim_win_get_width(0) > 80
    end
<


                                                       *feline-Component-icon*

Component icon                         Some inbuilt providers such as
                                       `git_branch` provide default icons. If
                                       you either don’t have a patched font
                                       or don’t like the default icon that
                                       Feline provides, or if you want an icon
                                       for a component that doesn’t have any
                                       default icons, you may set this value to
                                       use any icon you want instead.


The component’s icon can be a table, string or function. By default, the icon
inherits the component’s highlight, but you can also change the highlight
specifically for the icon. To do this, you need to pass a table containing
`str` and `hl`, where `str` would represent the icon and `hl` would represent
the icon highlight. The icon’s highlight works just like the `hl`
component’s values.

There’s also another value you can set if the value of `icon` is a table,
which is `always_visible`. By default, the icon is not shown if the value
returned by the provider is empty. If you want the icon to be shown even when
the provider string is empty, you need to set `always_visible` to `true`.

>
    -- Setting icon to a string
    icon = ' + '
    
    -- Setting icon to a function
    icon = function() return ' - ' end
    
    -- Setting icon to a table
    icon = {
        str = ' ~ ',
        hl = { fg = 'orange' }
    }
    
    -- Making icon always visible
    icon = {
        str = '',
        hl = {
            fg = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color(),
            bg = 'black',
            style = 'bold'
        },
        always_visible = true
    }
<


                                                  *feline-Component-highlight*

Component highlight                    The `hl` component value represents the
                                       component highlight. It can be a table,
                                       string or function.


If a string, it’ll use the given string as the name of the component
highlight group. In that case, this highlight group must be defined elsewhere
(i.e. in your colorscheme or your Neovim configuration).

If it’s a table, it’ll automatically generate a highlight group for you
based on the given values. The hl table can have four values: `fg`, `bg`,
`style` and `name`.

The `fg` and `bg` values are strings that represent the RGB hex or
|feline-name| of the foreground and background color of the highlight,
respectively. (eg: `'#FFFFFF'`, `'white'`). If `fg` or `bg` is not provided, it
uses the default foreground or background color provided in the `setup()`
function, respectively.

The `style` value is a string that determines the formatting style of the
component’s text (do `:help attr-list` in Neovim for more info). By default
it is set to `'NONE'`

The `name` value is a string that determines the name of highlight group
created by Feline (eg: `'StatusComponentVimInsert'`). If a name is not
provided, Feline automatically generates a unique name for the highlight group
based on the other values, so you can also just omit the `name` and Feline will
create new highlights for you when required. However, setting `name` may
provide a performance improvement since Feline caches highlight names and
doesn’t take the time to generate a name if the name is already provided by
the user.

Note that if `hl` is a function that can return different values, the highlight
is not redefined if the name stays the same. Feline only creates highlights
when they don’t exist, it never redefines existing highlights. So if `hl` is
a function that can return different values for `fg`, `bg` or `style`, make
sure to return a different value for `name` as well if you want the highlight
to actually change.

Here are a few examples using the `hl` value:

>
    -- As a table
    hl = {
        fg = 'skyblue'
    }
    
    -- As a string
    hl = "MyStatuslineHLGroup"
    
    -- As a function returning a table
    hl = function()
        return {
            name = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_highlight_name(),
            fg = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color(),
            style = 'bold'
        }
    end
    
    -- As a function returning a string
    hl = function()
        if require("feline.providers.vi_mode").get_vim_mode() == "NORMAL" then
            return "MyStatuslineNormal"
        else
            return "MyStatuslineOther"
        end
    end
<


                                                 *feline-Component-separators*

Component separators                   There are two types of separator values
                                       that you can put in a component, which
                                       are `left_sep` and `right_sep`, which
                                       represent the separator on the left and
                                       the right side of the component,
                                       respectively.


The value of `left_sep` and `right_sep` can just be set to a string that’s
displayed. You can use a function that returns a string just like the other
component values. The value can also be equal to the name of one of the
|feline-separator-presets|.

The value of `left_sep` and `right_sep` can also be a table or a function
returning a table. Inside the table there can be three values, `str`, `hl` and
`always_visible`. `str` represents the separator string and `hl` represents the
separator highlight. The separator’s highlight works just like the
component’s `hl` value. The only difference is that the separator’s `hl` by
default uses the parent’s background color as its foreground color.

By default, Feline doesn’t show a separator if the value returned by the
provider is empty. If you want the separator to be shown even when the
component string is empty, you can set the `always_visible` value in the
separator table to `true`. If unset or set to `false`, the separator is not
shown if the component string is empty.

You can also set `left_sep` and `right_sep` to be a `table` containing multiple
separator elements. It’s useful if you want to have different highlights for
different parts of the left/right separator of the same component, or if you
want to always show certain parts of the separator regardless of whether the
component string is empty, or if you just want to better organize the
component’s separator.

For example:

>
    -- Setting sep to a string
    left_sep = ' '
    
    -- Setting sep to a separator preset
    left_sep = 'slant_right'
    
    -- Setting sep to a table with highlight
    left_sep = {
        str = 'slant_left',
        hl = {
            fg = 'oceanblue',
            bg = 'bg'
        }
    }
    
    -- Making sep always visible
    right_sep = {
        str = ' ',
        always_visible = true
    }
    
    -- Setting sep to a function
    right_sep = function()
        local values = { 'right_rounded', 'right_filled', 'right' }
        return values[math.random(#values)]
    end
    
    -- Setting sep to a list separator elements
    right_sep = {
        {
            str = ' ',
            hl = {
                fg = 'NONE',
                bg = 'oceanblue'
            },
            always_visible = true
        },
        -- The line below is equivalent to { str = 'slant_right' }
        'slant_right'
    }

COMPONENT EXAMPLES ~

Now that we know of the possible values you can set in a component, let’s
make some actual components to show you how it all looks like together:

Component example

>
    -- Component that shows Vi mode with highlight
    components.active[1][1] = {
        provider = 'vi_mode',
        hl = function()
            return {
                name = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_highlight_name(),
                fg = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color(),
                style = 'bold'
            }
        end,
        right_sep = ' '
    }
    
    -- Component that shows file info
    components.active[1][2] = {
        provider = 'file_info',
        hl = {
            fg = 'white',
            bg = 'oceanblue',
            style = 'bold'
        },
        left_sep = {' ', 'slant_left_2'},
        right_sep = {'slant_right_2', ' '},
        -- Uncomment the next line to disable file icons
        -- icon = ''
    }
    
    -- Component that shows current file size
    components.active[1][3] = {
        provider = 'file_size',
        right_sep = {
            ' ',
            {
                str = 'slant_left_2_thin',
                hl = {
                    fg = 'fg',
                    bg = 'bg'
                }
            },
            ' '
        }
    }
    
    -- Component that shows file encoding
    components.active[2][1] = {
        provider = 'file_encoding'
    }
    
    -- Component that shows current git branch
    components.active[3][1] = {
        provider = 'git_branch',
        hl = {
            fg = 'white',
            bg = 'black',
            style = 'bold'
        },
        right_sep = {
            str = ' ',
            hl = {
                fg = 'NONE',
                bg = 'black'
            }
        }
    }

[**NOTE:** Remember to initialize the components table before assigning
anything to it]

SETUP FUNCTION                                         *feline-setup-function*

Now that you know about the components table and how Feline components work,
you can learn about Feline’s `setup()` function. The `setup()` function
initializes Feline with your provided configuration. The configuration can be
passed to the function through a table. The available configuration options are
listed below:


- `preset` - Set it to use a preconfigured statusline. Currently it can be equal to either `default` for the default statusline or `noicon` for the default statusline without icons. You don’t have to put any of the other values if you use a preset, but if you do, your settings will override the preset’s settings. To see more info such as how to modify a preset to build a statusline, see: |feline-modifying-an-existing-preset|
- `components` - The |feline-components-table|.
- `conditional_components` - An array-like table containing conditionally enabled components tables, each element of the table must be a components table with an additional key, `condition`, which would be a function without arguments that returns a boolean value. If the function returns `true` for a certain window, then that components table will be used for the statusline of that window instead of the default components table. If multiple conditional components match a certain window, the first one in the table will be used. An example usage of this option is shown below:


>
    conditional_components = {
        {
            -- Only use this components table for the 2nd window
            condition = function()
                return vim.api.nvim_win_get_number(0) == 2
            end,
            active = {
                -- Components used for active window
            },
            inactive = {
                -- Components used for inactive windows
            },
        },
        {
            -- Only use this components table for buffers of filetype 'lua'
            condition = function()
                return vim.api.nvim_buf_get_option(0, 'filetype') == 'lua'
            end,
            active = {
                -- Components used for active window
            },
            inactive = {
                -- Components used for inactive windows
            },
        }
    }
<



- `custom_providers` - A table containing user-defined |feline-provider-functions|. For example:


>
    custom_providers = {
        window_number = function()
            return tostring(vim.api.nvim_win_get_number(0))
        end
    }
<



- `theme` - Either a string containing the color theme name or a table containing the colors. The theme’s `fg` and `bg` values also represent the default foreground and background colors, respectively. To know more about Feline themes, take a look at the |feline-themes| section
- `separators` - A table containing custom |feline-separator-presets|.
- `force_inactive` - A table that determines which buffers should always have the inactive statusline, even when they are active. It can have 3 values inside of it, `filetypes`, `buftypes` and `bufnames`, all three of them are tables which contain Lua patterns to match against file type, buffer type and buffer name respectively.<br><br>
    Default:


>
    {
        filetypes = {
            '^NvimTree$',
            '^packer$',
            '^startify$',
            '^fugitive$',
            '^fugitiveblame$',
            '^qf$',
            '^help$'
        },
        buftypes = {
            '^terminal$'
        },
        bufnames = {}
    }
<



- `disable` - Similar to `force_inactive`, except the statusline is disabled completely. Configured the same way as `force_inactive`. Feline doesn’t disable the statusline on anything by default.
- `vi_mode_colors` - A table containing colors associated with Vi modes. It can later be used to get the color associated with the current Vim mode using `require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color()`. For more info on it see the |feline-vi-mode| section.<br><br>
    Here is a list of all possible vi_mode names used with the default color associated with them:


│    Mode     │     Description     │    Value    │
│NORMAL       │Normal mode          │'green'      │
│OP           │Operator pending mode│'green'      │
│INSERT       │Insert mode          │'red'        │
│VISUAL       │Visual mode          │'skyblue'    │
│LINES        │Visual lines mode    │'skyblue'    │
│BLOCK        │Visual block mode    │'skyblue'    │
│REPLACE      │Replace mode         │'violet'     │
│V-REPLACE    │Virtual Replace mode │'violet'     │
│ENTER        │Enter mode           │'cyan'       │
│MORE         │More mode            │'cyan'       │
│SELECT       │Select mode          │'orange'     │
│COMMAND      │Command mode         │'green'      │
│SHELL        │Shell mode           │'green'      │
│TERM         │Terminal mode        │'green'      │
│NONE         │None                 │'yellow'     │



- `highlight_reset_triggers` - Feline automatically resets its cached highlights on certain autocommands to prevent the statusline colors from getting messed up. The value of `highlight_reset_triggers` can be set to a table containing a list of autocommands that’ll trigger a highlight reset.<br><br>
    Default: `{'SessionLoadPost', 'ColorScheme'}`


UTILITY FUNCTIONS                                   *feline-utility-functions*

Feline provides a few utility functions that allow you to customize or modify
Feline on the fly. These are discussed below.

RESET HIGHLIGHT ~

If, for some reason, you want to clear all highlights that Feline sets (useful
if you want to reload your entire Neovim config which may mess up highlights),
you can do:

>
    require('feline').reset_highlights()
<


And then Feline will automatically regenerate those highlights when it needs
them, so you don’t have to worry about setting the highlights yourself.

ADDING AND USING PRESETS ~

If you want to add your own presets, you can do this through the
`require('feline').add_preset` function, like this:

>
    -- Components table for the preset
    local my_preset = {
        -- Insert components here
    }
    
    require('feline').add_preset('my_preset_name', my_preset)
<


You can also use a preset using `require('feline').use_preset`, like this:

>
    require('feline').use_preset('my_preset_name')
<


EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION                           *feline-example-configuration*

You can check out the code in the default preset
<lua/feline/presets/default.lua> to see how the components in it are set up so
you can get a good practical idea of how to use the tools that Feline gives you
to create all kinds of different statusline components.

MODIFYING AN EXISTING PRESET             *feline-modifying-an-existing-preset*

If you like the defaults for the most part but there’s some things you want
to change, then you’d be glad to know that it’s easy to just modify an
existing preset to get the statusline configuration you want. Just do:

>
    -- Substitute preset_name with the name of the preset you want to modify.
    -- eg: "default" or "noicon"
    local components = require('feline.presets')[preset_name]
<


After that, you can just modify the components and call the
|feline-setup-function| with the preset as you normally would.

DEFAULT PROVIDERS                                   *feline-default-providers*

Feline by default has some built-in providers to make your life easy. They are:

│             Name             │                Description                │
│|feline-vi_mode|              │Current vim mode                           │
│|feline-position|             │Get line and column number of cursor       │
│line_percentage               │Current line percentage                    │
│|feline-scroll_bar|           │Scroll bar that shows file progress        │
│|feline-file_info|            │Get file icon, name and modified status    │
│file_size                     │Get file size                              │
│file_type                     │Get file type                              │
│file_encoding                 │Get file encoding                          │
│file_format                   │Get file format                            │
│|feline-git_branch|           │Shows current git branch                   │
│|feline-git_diff_added|       │Git diff added count                       │
│|feline-git_diff_removed|     │Git diff removed count                     │
│|feline-git_diff_changed|     │Git diff changed count                     │
│lsp_client_names              │Name of LSP clients attached to current buf│
│                              │fer                                        │
│|feline-diagnostic_errors|    │Diagnostics errors count                   │
│                              │                                           │
│|feline-diagnostic_warnings|  │Diagnostics warnings count                 │
│                              │                                           │
│|feline-diagnostic_hints|     │Diagnostics hints count                    │
│|feline-diagnostic_info|      │Diagnostics info count                     │


VI-MODE ~

The vi-mode provider by itself only shows an icon. To actually indicate the
current Vim mode, you have to use
`require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color()` for the component’s
`hl.fg`.

Note that this is different if you set the `icon` value of the component to
`''`, in that case it’ll use the name of the mode instead of an icon, which
is what the `noicon` preset uses.

Here is the simplest method to make a component with proper Vi-mode indication:

>
    -- Remember to change "components.active[1][1]" according to the rest of your config
    components.active[1][1] = {
        provider = 'vi_mode',
        hl = function()
            return {
                name = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_highlight_name(),
                fg = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color(),
                style = 'bold'
            }
        end,
        right_sep = ' ',
        -- Uncomment the next line to disable icons for this component and use the mode name instead
        -- icon = ''
    }
<


The Vi-mode provider also provides a helper function
`get_mode_highlight_name()` which can be used through
`require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_highlight_name()`, it returns the
highlight name for the current mode, which you can then use for the
provider’s `hl.name` to give its highlight groups meaningful names.

The Vi-mode provider can take some provider options through the provider
`opts`: - `show_mode_name` (boolean): If true, show the mode name regardless of
whether the icon is set or not. Useful if you want to see both the indicator
icon and the mode name.<br> Default: `true` if component’s icon is set to
`''`, `false` otherwise. - `padding` (boolean): This setting determines if and
how the mode name is padded. Note that this configuration is only valid when
`show_mode_name` is `true` or if the component’s icon is set to `''`. The
value of this option can be either set to `false` to disable padding or be one
of `'left'`, `'center'` or `'right'`.<br> Default: `false`

POSITION ~

The `position` provider can take a `padding` provider option, which may be
either `true` or `false` and will determine whether the position numbers are
padded with spaces or not.

SCROLL BAR ~

The `scroll_bar` provider can take a `reverse` provider option, which may be
either `true` or `false` and will determine if the scroll bar is reversed,
which may be useful if you want the scroll bar to have natural scrolling.

FILE INFO ~

The `file_info` provider has some special provider options that can be passed
through the provider `opts`:


- `colored_icon` (boolean): Determines whether file icon should use color
    inherited from `nvim-web-devicons`.<br> Default: `true`
- `file_modified_icon` (string): The icon that is shown when a file is
    modified.<br> Default:`'●'`
- `file_readonly_icon` (string): The icon that is shown when a file is
    read-only.<br> Default:`'🔒'`
- `type` (string): Determines which parts of the filename are shown. Its value
    can be one of:
    - `'full-path'`: Full path of the file (eg: `'/home/user/.config/nvim/init.lua'`)
    - `'short-path'`: Shortened path of the file (eg: `'/h/u/.c/n/init.lua'`)
    - `'base-only'`: Show only base filename and extension (eg: `'init.lua'`)
    - `'relative'`: File path relative to the current directory.
    - `'relative-short'`: Combination of `'relative'` and `'short-path'`.
    - `'unique'`: Unique substring of the full path.<br>
        For example: If you have three buffers with the paths `'/home/user/file.lua'`, `'/home/user/dir1/file.lua'` and `'/home/user/dir2/file.lua'`, Feline will show the names `'user/file.lua'`, `'dir1/file.lua'` and `'dir2/file.lua'` for them, respectively.<br>
        If there’s no files that share the same name, it behaves the same as `'base-only'`.
    - `'unique-short'`: Combination of `'unique'` and `'short-path'`.
    <br>Default: `'base-only'`


FILE TYPE ~

The file type provider has the following options:


- `filetype_icon` (boolean): Whether the file type icon is shown alongside the file type.
    Default: `false`
- `colored_icon` (boolean): Determines whether file icon should use color inherited from `nvim-web-devicons`.<br>
    Default: `true`
- `case` (string): The case of the file type string. Possible values are: `'uppercase'`, `'titlecase'` and `'lowercase'`.<br>
    Default: `'uppercase'`


GIT ~

The git providers all require gitsigns.nvim
<https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim/>, make sure you have it installed
when you use those providers, otherwise they’ll have no output.

The git provider also provides a utility function
`require('feline.providers.git').git_info_exists()` for checking if any git
information exists.

DIAGNOSTICS ~

The diagnostics and LSP providers all require the Neovim built-in LSP to be
configured and at least one LSP client to be attached to the current buffer,
else they’ll have no output.

The diagnostics provider also provides a utility function
`require('feline.providers.lsp').diagnostics_exist` for checking if any
diagnostics exists. You can also optionally provide a `severity` function
argument to only check for diagnostics of that severity. The value of
`severity` must be one of the Neovim diagnostic API severities (eg:
`vim.diagnostic.severity.WARN`). For more info on diagnostic severities, do
`:help vim.diagnostic.severity` in Neovim.

THEMES                                                         *feline-themes*

Feline supports different themes to customize your statusline colors on the
fly. A theme is a Lua table associating color names with their RGB hex codes.
Feline only has one theme built-in, which is the default theme. However, it’s
possible to add new themes to Feline. See the |feline-adding-new-themes|
section for more info.

There are mainly two ways of using a theme. The first is to set the value of
`theme` in the |feline-setup-function| to the theme name or value. The second
way is through the `require('feline').use_theme` function. `use_theme` can take
the theme name as an argument. For example, this is how to use the default
theme:

>
    require('feline').use_theme('default')
<


`use_theme` can also take the theme table directly as argument, like this:

>
    -- Theme table
    local my_theme = {
        red = '#FF0000',
        green = '#00FF00',
        blue = '#0000FF'
    }
    
    require('feline').use_theme(my_theme)
<


ADDING NEW THEMES ~

If you’re developing a plugin or colorscheme and wish to support Feline for
that plugin / colorscheme or if you’re just a user who wants to be able to
quickly switch your statusline colors, you’d be glad to know that it’s
possible to add custom color themes for Feline. You just have to call
`require('feline').add_theme` with the theme name and the colors table. Like
this:

>
    -- Theme table
    local my_theme = {
        red = '#FF0000',
        green = '#00FF00',
        blue = '#0000FF'
    }
    
    require('feline').add_theme('my_theme_name', my_theme)
<


The user can then later use that theme through one of the two ways mentioned
above.

USING THEME COLORS ~

To use colors from a theme, just use the color name instead of the RGB hex code
in your component’s `hl` value, like this:

>
    hl = {
        bg = 'oceanblue',
        fg = 'white'
    }
<


DEFAULT COLOR THEME ~

Feline comes with a default color theme by default, and it falls back to this
theme if a color name is not found in the current theme. Here are the colors
available in the default theme and their values:

│    Name     │    Value    │
│fg           │'#D0D0D0'    │
│bg           │'#1F1F23'    │
│black        │'#1B1B1B'    │
│skyblue      │'#50B0F0'    │
│cyan         │'#009090'    │
│green        │'#60A040'    │
│oceanblue    │'#0066cc'    │
│magenta      │'#C26BDB'    │
│orange       │'#FF9000'    │
│red          │'#D10000'    │
│violet       │'#9E93E8'    │
│white        │'#FFFFFF'    │
│yellow       │'#E1E120'    │


SEPARATOR PRESETS                                   *feline-separator-presets*

Instead of having to remember unicode values for separator glyphs or having to
constantly copy-paste them, you can use Feline’s separator presets instead.
They allow you to either use Feline’s |feline-default-separators| or your own
manually defined separators (added through the |feline-setup-function|) by just
using their name. For example:

>
    right_sep = 'slant_right'
<


Below is a list of all the default separator names and their values:

DEFAULT SEPARATORS ~

│         Name         │  Value  │
│vertical_bar          │'┃'    │
│vertical_bar_thin     │'│'    │
│left                  │''    │
│right                 │''    │
│block                 │'█'    │
│left_filled           │''    │
│right_filled          │''    │
│slant_left            │''    │
│slant_left_thin       │''    │
│slant_right           │''    │
│slant_right_thin      │''    │
│slant_left_2          │''    │
│slant_left_2_thin     │''    │
│slant_right_2         │''    │
│slant_right_2_thin    │''    │
│left_rounded          │''    │
│left_rounded_thin     │''    │
│right_rounded         │''    │
│right_rounded_thin    │''    │
│circle                │'●'    │


TIPS AND TRICKS                                       *feline-tips-and-tricks*

GET CURRENT WINDOW OR BUFFER ~

When the statusline for a window is being generated, Neovim temporarily sets
the current window and buffer to the window and buffer for which the statusline
is being generated.

This is important to note when you set a component value to a function. Inside
a component value that’s set to a function, functions like
`vim.api.nvim_get_current_win()` and `vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()` will
return the statusline window and buffer instead of the actual current window
and buffer number. In order to access the actual current window or buffer, you
have to use `vim.g.actual_curbuf` or `vim.g.actual_curwin` (respectively)
inside the function instead. For example:

>
    -- Provider function that shows current window number
    provider = function()
        return vim.g.actual_curwin
    end
    
    -- Provider function that shows name of current buffer
    provider = function()
        return vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(tonumber(vim.g.actual_curbuf))
    end
<


Note that the values of both `vim.g.actual_curwin` and `vim.g.actual_curbuf`
are strings, not numbers. So if you want to use them as a number, use
`tonumber()` to convert the string to a number first, as shown in the second
example.

HIGHLIGHT SECTION GAPS ~

By default, gaps between two sections inherit the highlight of the last element
of the section. If you wish to customize the highlight of the gap between two
sections, you can just add a component with only an `hl` value to the end of
the first section.

For example, if you had two sections in the active statusline and wanted the
gap between the first and second section to use a certain background color, you
could do this:

>
    components.active[1] = {
        {
            -- Insert all components of first section here
    
            -- Component for customizing highlight for the gap between section 1 and 2
            {
                hl = {
                    -- Replace 'oceanblue' with whatever color you want the gap to be.
                    bg = 'oceanblue'
                }
            }
        },
        {
            -- Insert all components of second section here
        }
    }
<


It’s even simpler if you want to use the default `bg` color for the gap
between sections. In that case, you can just put an empty component at the end
of the first section. You don’t even have the define the `hl` manually since
`hl` by default uses the default `bg` as its background.
